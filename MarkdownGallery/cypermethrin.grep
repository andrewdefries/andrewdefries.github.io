journal.pntd.0002074.txt-Significant escape responses were also observed at ,100% SAC using KFAR of all test compounds. In most trials, KD and
journal.pntd.0002074.txt-24 hour mortality rates were higher in mosquitoes that did not escape than in those that escaped. In Thailand, field
journal.pntd.0002074.txt-validation studies indicated an early time of exit (by four hours) and 40% increase in escape using KFAR of
journal.pntd.0002074.txt:alphacypermethrin at 75% SAC compared to a matched chemical-free control. In Peru, however, the maximum increase in

journal.pone.0029242.txt:resistance to beta-cypermethrin, the relationship between L1014F
journal.pone.0029242.txt-substitution frequency and mosquito survival when challenged
journal.pone.0029242.txt:with beta-cypermethrin was analyzed in this study. The L1014F
journal.pone.0029242.txt-substitution not only showed a strong positive correlation with
journal.pone.0029242.txt-LC50 (R2
journal.pone.0029242.txt-= 0.9519) but also a significantly high frequency (75% to
journal.pone.0029242.txt-84%), corresponding to the resistance level against beta-cyper-
journal.pone.0029242.txt-methrin in all the field populations (700 to 2100-fold). This finding
journal.pone.0029242.txt-therefore supports previous studies that suggested that the L1014F
journal.pone.0029242.txt:substitution is the key mutation responsible of beta-cypermethrin
journal.pone.0029242.txt-resistance. An alternative substitution of leucine to cysteine (Leu to
journal.pone.0029242.txt-Cys) in the same location showed a relative low frequency within
journal.pone.0029242.txt-populations; in spite of its strong positive correlation with LC50,
journal.pone.0029242.txt-this Leu/Cys substitution is unlikely to play an important role in
journal.pone.0029242.txt:beta-cypermethrin resistance. Martinez-Torres [22] reported that
journal.pone.0029242.txt-L1014S substitution in one strain showed a slight increase in

journal.pone.0060929.txt-House flies, Musca domestica L., are important pests of dairy operations worldwide, with the ability to adapt wide range of

journal.pone.0060929.txt-mixture of PBO with different pyrethroids increased the toxicity of
journal.pone.0060929.txt:cypermethrin, deltamethrin and permethrin [33]. Although PBO
